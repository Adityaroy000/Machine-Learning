#Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Algorithms repository! 🚀 This repository serves as a personal collection of ML algorithms and techniques that I am exploring and implementing. It acts as a reference for me to understand and revise key concepts in machine learning.

📌 What's Inside?

This repository currently includes implementations of the following algorithms and techniques:

🔹 Regression Algorithms

Linear Regression - Basic regression model for predicting continuous values.

Ridge Regression - A regularized version of linear regression to prevent overfitting.

Lasso Regression - Another regularized regression model that also performs feature selection.

🔹 Classification Algorithms

Logistic Regression - A fundamental classification algorithm used for binary classification problems.

🔹 Outlier Detection

Interquartile Range (IQR) Method - A statistical method to detect outliers in a dataset.

Other Outlier Detection Techniques - Additional methods to identify and handle outliers effectively.

📖 How to Use?

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Adityaroy000/Machine-Learning.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo-name

Run the notebooks/scripts to explore the algorithms.

🔧 Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 Future Plans

Adding more ML algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Implementing feature scaling techniques

Exploring hyperparameter tuning methods
